### Reflection Post

For this project I made a tool to help people with dyslexia read better. I have dyslexia myself so I know how hard reading can be. Letters can feel mixed up and that makes school and other stuff frustrating. I wanted to make something that gives people more control over how text looks so it’s easier to read.

The tool is like a short quiz. You pick the font, size, spacing, background color, and other settings that feel best to you. At the end it shows a reading page that uses all your choices. It’s simple but it works.

Building the site was sometimes tricky. I used React and regular CSS. I didn’t use any outside tools or libraries. It took some time to make it look good and be centered on the screen. I also had to figure out how to change styles based on what people picked.

If I had more time I’d make it into a Chrome extension so people could use it on real websites. I’d also add a way to go back and change answers.

I think the project turned out well. It’s helpful and made for real people who need it. I learned a lot and I’m glad I made something useful.
